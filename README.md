# Here are some write up to conclude for the GraphQL Tutorial

In a short way, basically to get Apollo Server (GraphQL) up and running.
I have learned that the followings has to be defined:
- Schemas
    > define the structure of the data, on how the client can query it.
- Data set
    > can be data from database, REST API, hardcoded data or others.
- Resolver
    > helps to communicate with Apollo Server on how to fetch the data associated with a particular type.
